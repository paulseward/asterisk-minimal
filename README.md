# Minimal CNet Asterisk config

No DAHDI, no voicemail, no bells, no whistles.  Just a minimal starting point for asterisk configuration.  Includes SIP and IAX2 support.

The config will attempt to include the following files:
* `local/extensions.conf` Your local dialplan
* `local/sip.conf` Your local SIP trunks/peers/users
